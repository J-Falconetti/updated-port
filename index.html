            <p>My scope's negative. I don't see anything. Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll
              be
              on top of you before your scope can pick them up. Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it! I can't see
              it!
              Where is he?! He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him. Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.
              Got
              him!</p>
            <p>Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold
              together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are
              still
              two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your
              fault.
            </p>
            <p>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss.
              Luke,
              at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll
              stay
              back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure
              the
              computer can hit it? Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle! What about the tower? You worry about
              those fighters! I'll worry about the tower! Artoo...that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if
              you
              can't lock it down! I'm hit! I can't stay with you. Get clear, Wedge. You can't do any more good back
              there!
              Sorry!</p>
